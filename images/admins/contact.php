				I have been an admin for all 6 of the previous games, which means I am one of the rare original admins! I do a lot of the background set up stuffs and make sure emails are handled, and I also try to be around game-play as much as possible.  I also review all missions and keep track of all game info. I am usually the admin you sign in with at missions, usually.

				Hallo! I'm one of the two that make the tough decisions. I help make the details that go behind the game and watch it work out. I also write the mission details and nightly emails for the zombies. Played one game, but this will be my third game adminning. I AM THE ZD.

				I'm here to make sure you have fun, and you WILL have fun, or ELSE!  I write most of the human missions and emails and do a little of whatever needs to get done to make the game run smoothly.  I love chatting about the game so feel free to bring it up.  I've played 3 games and this will be my 3rd as an admin.

			<p>
				Why, Hello there, lovelies. After playing some games, I decided that adminning would be the best road, and since I'm still here I guess I did an OK job. I'm here to make sure the game runs as smoothly as possible and to try to keep everyone in line. Sometimes this involves a very angry face and loud noises.
