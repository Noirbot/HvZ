			<p>
				As the oldest person on the team this makes me the most wise, right? No, darn. So I have been Adminning for a few games now, so I know how this whole deal works. I help with some of the mission writing for both sides. I also have become the role player for some of the missions. I am here to help the zombies win... wait that's not right. I am here to help the game run as smoothly as possible which can cause some loud noises to emanate from my direction at points.

				This is my third game as an Admin, and my final game as a Head Admin.  I've been involved in every game except for the very first.  Leader of the Resistance, General of the Horde, Original Zombie, Hivemind, Survivor till the Finale, Previous Record Holder for Circle of Death, and as an all around take charge player I've done a lot within HvZ.  Now as a hopefully graduating 5th Year CS Major, it's my job to make sure everyone has a complete blast in this semester's game!

                Hallo! I used to be one of the ones that made the tough decisions, but now I've returned as a regular admin for my fifth game of HvZ. I do mission and plot writing, and during planning I remind the other admins when their ideas are too complicated. I help coordinate missions and you'll likely see me a lot. Remember to listen when your friendly admin-bot projects loud noises, it tends to be important!

				Why hello everyone! Kersh is the name. I am here to make sure that everyone has a fun and exciting week of resisting, nomming, and overall fighting the good fight. This will be my third time adminning, so I do know a thing or two about the game. Feel free to approach me in any wide open and easily accessible area that is in play for nice long conversations about how to be a successful human player. Zombies are also welcome to BRAINS BRAINS BRAINS! And remember kids, <h1><center>DON'T BE A JERK!</center></h1>

				Hey there, nice to meat you! The name's Wes, but you might have heard of me as Thor, God of Thunder. I've played four games, twice surviving to the finish and once as your friendly neighborhood OZ. Please, for the love of the gods, don't do anything stupid/unsafe because I haven't lost my patience in seven years, and I don't think you want to anger the mighty Thor.

               Peace and Long Life. I am Dewey Holland. A 4th year Mechanical Engineer who has only played two games. However, I was the crazy guy who purposefully went zombie. The reason being to put on a good show and make the game more interesting. This is my first time as an admin. However, I still want to put on a good show. So don't fear the stun timer, don't be a jerk, and have some fun.
