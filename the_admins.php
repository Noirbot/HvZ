				Why hello everyone! Kersh is the name. I am here to make sure that everyone has a fun and exciting week of resisting, nomming, and overall fighting the good fight. This will be my fourth time adminning, so I do know a thing or two about the game. Feel free to approach me in any wide open and easily accessible area that is in play for nice long conversations about how to be a successful human player. Zombies are also welcome to BRAINS BRAINS BRAINS! And remember kids,
				<strong>DON'T BE A JERK!</strong>

				Previously, four games, once as OZ. Now, known as Thor, third game as admin, and first game as co-head admin. If you&#x2019;re not having fun, if you&#x2019;re not being smart, if you&#x2019;re trying to break the game, you&#x2019;re doing it wrong. Now go forth, stun and feed until your heart's content!

          Hallo! I used to be one of the ones that made the tough decisions, but now I&#x2019;ve returned as a regular admin for my sixth game of HvZ (10th game woot woot!). I do mission and plot writing, and during planning I remind the other admins when their ideas are too complicated. I help coordinate missions and you&#x2019;ll likely see me a lot. Remember to listen when your friendly admin-bot projects loud noises, it tends to be important!

Or you may never see me which tends to be the trend, for I am like a shadow, no one worries about him. Well, know that I will be watching. Let the crazy begin!

               Howdy!  I have played and adminned one  game each and have enjoyed each thoroughly.  I try to keep the details of missions clear so people know what&#x2019;s going on, and generally think an informed zombie is a dangerous zombie, and an informed human has tastier (but maybe more elusive) brains.

I have participated in HvZ twice and this will be my second game after ascending to the realms of the Admins. I know the rules forwards and backwards and the gaps in between. Just give me a good ship and a star to fly her to. I believe that if you die a hero, you rise again to see yourself become a zombie. See you in the field!

               Hello everyone! I&#x2019;m a second-time admin, one-time player. I like to resolve disputes, answer e-mails, and bring epic music to epic missions. In this game, F is not for fire that burns down the whole town, so go to missions and have fun or I will smite you. May your life be spent bravely, and may your death be glorious!

               Good mornin&#x2019;, good afternoon, and good evening! The name&#x2019;s So-mi and I&#x2019;ll be joining the Admin team this year. I&#x2019;ve played HvZ twice, going into the finale as a human once and a zombie the next. Though I may be new to admin-ing, I certainly am not new at gently reprimanding rule-breakers, trolls, and unpleasant people. If you break a rule, I will break you (... Maybe... Most likely). At any rate, have fun and play smart (camping out at Klaus until 11PM is not having fun OR playing smart ;) )!

           <p>
               General rule of thumb: If I am speaking, I am probably being sarcastic. Take that as you will. Hello! I have been part of the game since I was talked into joining freshman year by a friend, so, after 4 games, I decided to try my hand at admining. Zombies shall always prevail, so do not expect me to give you humans the time of day. Get your brain devoured, then you can speak to me. Remember, surviving as a human is only half the game, so do not be lame and rage quit when you inevitably become a zombie. Exact revenge on the humans left and enjoy the game.

               Greetings players! I&#x2019;m a first-time admin who's played the game 4 times. You probably remember me as the guy who played as a war correspondent filming the apocalypse last game (on a related note, I swear I&#x2019;ll release that footage eventually). I&#x2019;m primarily in charge of the plot this year, and we&#x2019;re trying something new in cooperation with BuzzStudios, so I&#x2019;m the guy to (thank/swear vigorously at) if it (works out/fails miserably). Oh, and the safe word is 'banana'. Have fun!
